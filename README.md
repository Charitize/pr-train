## What does this do?
Simply put, if you have a chain of PRs and you modify one of them,
`git pr-train` ensures all your branches in the chain get updated
without the risk of you losing your zen (which happens if you try
to do this onerous process manually).

## How does this thing work?
Note: We expect your branches to follow this simple naming scheme: `your-name/brief-feature-description/[0-9]+(/optional-part)`, e.g. `fred/billing-refactor/1/frontend-changes`.

#### Example:
Say you want to split your work into multiple PRs. You create a chain of PRs (or a "PR train") looking like this:
 * `fred/billing-refactor/1/frontend`
 * `fred/billing-refactor/2/backend`
 * `fred/billing-refactor/3/tests`

Now if you modify a branch, you will want all the subsequent branches to receive the change.

`pr-train` does just that for you. It takes all the subbranches, sorts them and merges each into their child branch (i.e., branch 1 into branch 2, branch 2 into branch 3 etc).

It also makes sure there is a `fred/billing-refactor/combined` branch and all the other sub-branches are merged into it (just in case you need to run linting etc that you don't want to put into the last branch).

## Installation
Run `npm install -g git-pr-train`.

## Usage
Just run `git pr-train` in your working dir when you're on any branch that belongs to a PR train. You don't have to be on branch 1. Use `-r/--rebase` option if you'd like to rebase branches rather than merge.

`git pr-train -p` will also push your updated changes to remote `origin` (configurable via `--remote` option).

### Automagically creating GitHub PRs
**Pre-requisite**: Create a `${HOME}/.pr-train` file with a single line which is your GH access token (you can create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)).

Pass `--create-prs` to create GH PRs with a "content table" section. PR titles are taken from the commit message titles of each branch HEAD. You'll be promted before the PRs are created. Please note that re-running with `--create-prs` will update the existing PRs. So you might not want to do that.
